Hi, I'm Unai! I'm a PhD student in Statistics at the [University of Munich (LMU)](https://www.lmu.de/en/), where I study the foundations of prediction systems used to guide resource allocations in the public sector. A core theme of my research is thinking holistically about decision-making systems, examining not just the predictive algorithms themselves but how they are designed, deployed, and integrated into broader decision-making processes.

I joined the [Social Data Science and AI Lab](https://www.stat.lmu.de/soda/en/) in October 2022, supported by the Konrad Zuse School for Excellence in Reliable AI and the [Munich Center for Machine Learning](https://mcml.ai). I'm advised by Christoph Kern and Frauke Kreuter. In fall 2024, I was a visiting fellow at [Harvard's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu), hosted by Cynthia Dwork and Juan Carlos Perdomo.

I have a background in Physics with a Bachelor's and Master's degree from [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en), where I specialized in dynamical systems, networks, and statistical machine learning for time series. Before my PhD, I worked as a research associate at the [Hertie School Data Science Lab](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/research-centres/hertie-school-data-science-lab) in Berlin, where I explored machine learning applications in public policy and governance.

I co-organize [Data Science for Social Good Munich](https://www.dssgxmunich.org), a 2-month paid fellowship program where aspiring data scientists tackle real-world machine learning challenges for social impact. If you're interested in partnering with us on a project, please reach out [here](https://www.dssgxmunich.org/call-for-partners).
