      abstract={Machine Learning (ML) systems are becoming instrumental in the public sector, with applications spanning areas like criminal justice, social welfare, financial fraud detection, and public health. While these systems offer great potential benefits to institutional decision-making processes, such as improved efficiency and reliability, they still face the challenge of aligning nuanced policy objectives with the precise formalization requirements necessitated by ML models. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between ML model requirements and public sector decision-making by presenting a comprehensive overview of key technical challenges where disjunctions between policy goals and ML models commonly arise. We concentrate on pivotal points of the ML pipeline that connect the model to its operational environment, discussing the significance of representative training data and highlighting the importance of a model setup that facilitates effective decision-making. Additionally, we link these challenges with emerging methodological advancements, encompassing causal ML, domain adaptation, uncertainty quantification, and multi-objective optimization, illustrating the path forward for harmonizing ML and public sector objectives.}

  abstract = {Automated decision-making (ADM) systems are being deployed across a diverse range of critical problem areas such as social welfare and healthcare. Recent work highlights the importance of causal ML models in ADM systems, but implementing them in complex social environments poses significant challenges. Research on how these challenges impact the performance in specific downstream decision-making tasks is limited. Addressing this gap, we make use of a comprehensive real-world dataset of jobseekers to illustrate how the performance of a single CATE model can vary significantly across different decision-making scenarios and highlight the differential influence of challenges such as distribution shifts on predictions and allocations.}

  abstract     = {Ordinal data, crucial for many scientific disciplines, consists of a discrete set of labels for which a natural ordering but no specified distance measure exists. In practice, this pecu- liarity of ordinal data is oftentimes overlooked, with many models making the simplified assumption that it can be interpreted as either metric or categorical. The rise of digital tech- nologies allows the collection of ever larger data sets, facilitating the use of more powerful and expressive machine learning architectures. This thesis proposes and evaluates a deep probabilistic latent model for forecasting ordinal time series by integrating an ordered-logit model into a sequential variational autoencoder framework. The model is developed in the context of a multi-university research initiative (Living lab AI4U) with the goal to predict in- dividuals’ emotional trajectories using time series data collected from questionnaires on their smartphones to suggest personalized mental health interventions. The model is evaluated using empirical data collected during a psychiatric study and benchmark data matching this data is created to test the model’s theoretical limitations. Hierarchical parameter estimation is implemented to deal with sparse and short time series. The findings identify future av- enues for dealing with irregular time series, missing values and ways to integrate multimodal sensor data from smartphones.}
